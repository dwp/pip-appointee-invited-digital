      <p>It’s important you provide evidence or information about the impacts of any health conditions or disabilities on James' daily life, if you can.</p>

      <p>Providing evidence may mean:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>we can make a quicker decision on their application</li>
          <li>we can make an accurate decision and pay the right amount</li>
          <li>they may not need to attend an assessment with a health professional</li>
        </ul>

      <p>You should only upload photos or scanned images of documents you already have. These documents should show how their health condition or disability affects them.</p>

      <p>We will explain what types of evidence to include on the next screen.</p>

      <p>Do not request documents that need to be paid for, for example a letter from their GP. If we need this evidence we can ask for it ourselves, as long as we have your permission.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> If you're waiting for evidence</h2>
      <p>You should submit your claim on time even if you're waiting for evidence, for example a hospital or doctor's letter. You can add more evidence after you've submitted your claim.</p>
