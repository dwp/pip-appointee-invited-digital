          How James' health conditions or disabilities affect them</h1>

        <p>This is stage 2 of James' PIP claim. This stage is about their 
          health conditions or disabilities and how they affect them.</p>
       

            <p> You will be asked questions about their ability to carry out everyday activities. Your answers will help us assess their entitlement to PIP. You can also upload evidence to support the claim.</p>
            <p>Take your time and describe all the help they need. You do not have to answer all the questions in one go. You can save your progress at any point and continue later.</p>
      
          </ul>
