      <p>Dear Jasmine,</p>

      <p>Thank you for starting a Personal Independence 
        Payment (PIP) claim for <br> James Smith.</p>

      <p>For the second stage of the PIP application, we will ask 
        about their daily living and mobility needs to help us 
        make our decision. 
        </p>
      <p>If we need more information, we may invite you to do an 
        assesment by phone.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to fill in the application by</h2>

      <p>You will need to answer all the questions and upload any 
        evidence you have by: </p><br>
       <p><b>31 October 2024 </b> </p>
<br>
<p><b>Need more time? </p>
      <p>
        If you need a bit longer to fill in the form, let us know. 
        Otherwise, once the deadline has past, we may need to 
        end the PIP claim. </p> <p> Our contact details are at the end of this email.  </p>
<br>
      
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-s">Are they receiving Disability Living Allowance (DLA)? </h1>

     <p>DLA is being replaced by PIP. If they are getting DLA at 
      the moment, this will stop if you do not complete the 
      form by the return date.</p>
      <br>
     <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Useful tips before you start</h2>

     <p>It might be helpful to keep a diary for a few days. Note down:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how their condition or disability affects their daily life </li>
          <li>a list of things they need help with or find difficult</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>You can also gather information to help you fill in the 
            form and it can be uploaded as evidence to support your 
            answers.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you need to do next</h2>

     <p>You need to register to access our online service. </p>
     <p>We will ask you to enter your email address and some 
basic information. We will then send a 6 digit code to 
your mobile phone number. After we have verified it is 
you, you can set a password.</p>
      <p>Before you register, have the following ready: </p>
     <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the email address we sent this email to and access to your emails </li>
        <li>your mobile phone</li>
      <li>James' National Insurance number</li>
      <li>James' date of birth</li>
      
    </ul>
    <br>

      <p><b><a href="../apply-for-pip/account-home.html" >Register now</a></b></p> <br>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to complete the form</h2>

      <p>Once logged in, we will ask you questions about James' 
        health condition or disability and how it affects them. You 
        will also be able to upload any supporting evidence.</p>

      <p>You do not need to answer all the questions in one go 
        and can save and return.
         </p>

      <p>Save this email or bookmark the sign in page so you can 
        continue your application.</p>

        PDF guide for completing the form. You can download it once you have registered.</p>
