          How your health conditions or disabilities affect you</h1>

        <p>This is stage 2 of your PIP claim. This stage is about your 
          health conditions or disabilities and how they affect you.</p>
       

            <p> We'll ask you questions about your ability to carry out everyday 
              activities. Your answers will help us assess your entitlement to 
              PIP.</p>
            <p>Take your time and describe all the help you need. You do not 
              have to answer all the questions in one go. You can save your 
              progress at any point and continue later.</p>
            <p>  We'll ask you to upload supporting evidence for the claim. Be 
              sure to have this ready or you can log back in to upload.</p>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>

        <p>You will need:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <li>details of any medicines or treatments you have </li>
