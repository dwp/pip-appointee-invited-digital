      <p>It’s important you provide evidence or information about the impacts of any health conditions or disabilities on your daily life, if you can.</p>

      <p>Uploading evidence may mean:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>we can make a quicker decision on your claim</li>
          <li>we can make an accurate decision and pay you the right amount</li>
          <li>you may not need to attend an assessment with a health professional</li>
        </ul>

      <p>You should submit your claim on time even if you’re waiting for evidence, for example a hospital or doctor’s letter. You can add more evidence after you've submitted your claim.</p>
